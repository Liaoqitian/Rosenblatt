## Chapter Seven: Object-Oriented Design

Object-Oriented design questions require a candidate to sketch out the classes and methods to implement technical problems or real-life objects. 

#### How to approach? 

**Step 1: Handle Ambiguity **

It is essential to ask clarifying questions. When being asked an object-oriented design question, we should inquire who is going to use it and how they are going to use it. Depending on the question, we may even want to go through the six "W"s. 

**Step 2: Define the Core Objects**

After we fully understand what we are designing, we should consider what the "core objects" in a system are. 

**Step 3: Analyze Relationships**

Having more or less decided on our core objects, we now want to analyze the relationships between the objects. Which objects are members of which other objects? Do any objects inherit from any others? Are relationships many-to-many or one-to-many? 

**Step 4: Investigate actions**

Now we should have the basic outline of our object-oriented design. What remains is to consider the key actions taht the objects will take and how they relate to each other. 

#### Design Patterns 

There are mainly two types of design patterns
